  Template/TemplateName: # a target configuration template, identified by the "Template/" prefix (optional)
    # other non-template targets can inherit the settings defined here with the Extends setting
    # templates cannot be nested, so the Extends setting is not allowed on them.
    # aside from Extends, all target settings are also valid here.
    #
    # AddrMap and BaseRpx will default to TemplateName instead of TargetName here
    # if AddrMap/BaseRpx are set on both template and an extending target, the extending target has priority.
    #
    # all the list settings are merged together if set on both template and extending target.
